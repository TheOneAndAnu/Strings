# Strings
'Strings' is software/web app that produces sheet music or tablature for pieces of music. To put it in simpler terms, Ideally, the software analyses a piece of music, isolates the notes and chords played within it and identifies them based on the classic western chromatic scale system. All the while, it processes the BPM (Beats per measure) of the song structure and determines the chord or note changes taking place within a single time period (Pre-defined by the user). In doing so, the software is able to produce a simple tablature for the song that it has been fed to process.
